## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 

It is a dynamically-typed language. This means that you don't have to declare the data type of your variables before using them. 

It was developed by Netscape Corporation and later sponsored by Sun Microsystems.

JavaScript, alongside HTML and CSS is one of the core technologies of the world wide web.

It can be used to build server side applications

It is also used in mobile app development to create cross platform apps that can run on both iOS and android and also create desktop applications.
