## Seperation of Concerns and Promise
Separation of Concerns (SoC): A fundamental principle in software engineering and design aimed at breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. The goal is to organize a systemâ€™s components in a way that each part addresses a single concern, or a cohesive aspect of functionality, rather than mixing multiple concerns together.

Promise: Is an object in js with three states; pending, resolved, rejected. The states depend on current order of statements.

## Difference between undefined and Null
Undefined: In JavaScript, undefined typically means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It can also be returned when attempting to access an object property that does not exist, or when a function does not explicitly return a value. It represents the absence of any value or lack of existence.

Null: On the other hand, null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any value. It is often used as an explicit indication that a variable does not contain a meaningful value or that an object property intentionally does not exist.
