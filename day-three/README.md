## Boilerplate Code
In computer programming, boilerplate code or boilerplate refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. It is often used when referring to languages that are considered verbose, i.e. the programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal jobs.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It's a mechanism that allows web servers to specify which origins (domains) are permitted to access the resources of a web page. This is an important security concept in web development, as it helps prevent unauthorized access to resources from malicious websites.

When a web page makes a request to a different domain (origin), the browser typically blocks the request due to the same-origin policy, which is a security measure to prevent certain types of attacks, like cross-site scripting (XSS). CORS headers are used by web servers to indicate to the browser whether it's allowed to make requests from another origin.

By configuring CORS headers on the server side, developers can control which domains can access their resources, thus enabling safe communication between different origins while still maintaining security.
