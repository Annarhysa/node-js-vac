## Type Systems
- Dynamic Typing: Type checking is performed at runtime. Type of variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.
- Static Typing: Type checking performed during compile time. The type of variable is know at compile time. Pros: Easy to debug, less runtime errors. Cons: More work in development (Need to define types), slower execution since the compiler needs to check everything.
- Duck Typing: The type or the class of an object is less important than the method it defines. No need to check types at all. Check the presence of a given method or attribute.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, a superset of JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. 

## SQL and NoSQL
- SQL: A programming language used to manage data stored in relational databases. It allows users to interact with databases using commands that are translated into instructions for retrieving, manipulating data. 
- NoSQL: Databases use a variety of data models, including document-based, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexibility in data representation, allowing developers to store and retrieve data in a more dynamic and schema-less manner.
