  "description": "- Dynamic Typing: Type checking is performed at runtime. Type of variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.\r - Static Typing: Type checking performed during compile time. The type of variable is know at compile time. Pros: Easy to debug, less runtime errors. Cons: More work in development (Need to define types), slower execution since the compiler needs to check everything.\r - Duck Typing: The type or the class of an object is less important than the method it defines. No need to check types at all. Check the presence of a given method or attribute.",
